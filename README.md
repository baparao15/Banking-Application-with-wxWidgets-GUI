## Description of the Libraries Used in the Project

1. **`#include <iostream>`**  
   Used for input and output operations. Provides the standard input (`std::cin`), output (`std::cout`), and error (`std::cerr`) streams.

2. **`#include <fstream>`**  
   Enables file handling, such as reading from and writing to files. Used to manage account and admin data persistence.

3. **`#include <string>`**  
   Supports string manipulation, allowing operations like concatenation, comparison, and transformations.

4. **`#include <iomanip>`**  
   Provides control over the formatting of input and output, such as setting precision, aligning text, and controlling decimal points in numeric data.

5. **`#include <vector>`**  
   Offers a dynamic array-like structure to store and manage user-defined data, such as account information, efficiently.

6. **`#include <sstream>`**  
   Used for string stream operations, enabling conversion between strings and other data types or extracting formatted input from strings.

7. **`#include <wx/wx.h>`**  
   Part of the wxWidgets library, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). It supports multi-platform development, making the application visually appealing and user-friendly.

These libraries collectively empower the project to handle diverse functionalities, including GUI development, data management, and file handling.
